#pico-terminal-editor
This program ("pico") is a very small terminal-based text editor.   
  
I made it in a short amount of time as a fun project,  
therefore it is not meant as a replacement for full-fledged text editors.  
Only basic functionality (simple editing, saving, loading) is provided.

##Usage:
Press Esc to switch between file and commandline  
  
The following commands are available in the commandline as well as their shortcuts:  
-quit  (CTRL+Q)
-new   (CTRL+N)
-open --file-- (CTRL+O)
-save (CTRL+S)
-save --file-- (CTRL+W)
  
I may add search/search-replace and proper documentation in the future.
